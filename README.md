# Pacman Project!

This project was part of the MITxPro coding bootcamp. The project is a simple web app that creates pacman objects on the screen and they move and chomp as they travel across the screen. The 'Pacmen' individually switch directions when they reach the edge of the page and they chomp and travel at their own rate regardless of the behavior of the others.

### How to run:

1. Download the files into your computer
2. Open the index.html file in your preffered browser
3. Click add pacman to add the pacmen to the screen. Click start to make them move around the screen.

#### Future updates:

1. Create collision between the Pacmen
2. Style the background
